# Titanic-Tensorflow2-Project

This project was made for the Kaggle Titanic competition - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview

It uses Tensorflow 2 to create a machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 

The model achieved an 83.5% train and 78.5% test accuracy, ranking it in the top 14% of submissions entered at the time of writing.
